                    Although in my opinion and the opinion of many other mathematicians out there, this paradox has
                    been resolved by modern calculus. It is however, still fun to play around with the logic of a man who set out to prove
                    that motion is just an illusion. Yes, motion&#8230 every single one of those calorie buring walks you've taken,
                    the countless motion questions your physics teacher made you solve&#8230 all an illusion. But don't be so quick 
                    to dismiss this as another pitfall some ancient philosopher has drowned in by thinking outside the paradigm of
                    modern science, because this dude had pretty convincing argument.

                    <h1> Achilles and the Torotise</h1>

                    <span>
                            The Achilles and the Tortoise paradox describes a race between Achilles (any fast runner really) and a tortoise
                            (a much slower runner). Say the tortoise gets a head start of around <i>100m</i> and each runner maintains a constant speed 
                            throughout the race. Eventually, at some finite time, Achilles would reach the point where the tortoise started 
                            (he has traveled <i>100m</i>). But by this time the tortoise would have traveled some finite distance &#948. Consequently, 
                            the tortoise is now &#948 meters ahead of Achilles. Hmm! So the tortoise is still ahead. After another finite time Achilles 
                            would have traveled some extra &#948 meters, which means he is now where the tortoise was the last time. 
                            In that same finite time, the tortoise would have traveled another finite distance &#948<sub>1</sub>. 
                            The tortoise is still ahead. Quite frankly, we can continue this process infinitely. Logically, we can 
                            now conclude that in a race, a fast runner can never take the lead from a slower runner. WAIT WHAT!!!<br>

                    <h1>Dichotomy Paradox
                    </h1>
                    This one is quite simple. Suppose you want to take a calorie burning walk of 100 meters. Before getting to the 100 meter 
                    mark you would first have to get to the 50 meter mark. No problem right? But to get to the 50 meter mark you would first 
                    have to get to the 25 meter mark. To get to the 25 meter mark you need to get to the 12.5 meter mark. Now it's beginning 
                    to seem like you should just stick with pizza. Maybe you should because we can, theoretically, continue to bisect the 
                    distance you would need to travel infinitely. In effect you would need to complete an infinite number of tasks to get 
                    to the 100 meter mark. You should definitely stick with pizza.<br>

                    Anyway, since people have a tendency to not be able to complete an infinite amount of tasks, 
                    it's safe to conclude that nothing and no one could possibly move in this universe.

                    <h1>The Arrow in Flight</h1>
                    The arrow in flight paradox presents a thought about an arrow in motion. In any duration-less instance 
                    of time where no time elapses, the arrow is not moving to where it is not because no time elapses and 
                    the arrow isn't moving to where it currently is because it is already there. Since all of time is made 
                    of instances, therefore, motion is impossible.

                    <p>Most definitely, there is some error in these arguments (try moving around, just to make sure). 
                        But the question is ‘Where?’ All of these paradoxes are related in a way that we’ll discuss later on. 
                        For now, let’s start with the last because it’s a problem that’s plagued my mind and probably the minds 
                        of many physics students out there: ‘Instantaneous Velocity’. How can any object possibly have any 
                        velocity (described by the ratio of change in distance to change in time) in an instant where time 
                        doesn’t change? 
                        In science, to get the right answers we need to ask the right questions. 
                        Is it actually possible to have a single instance of time? That’s the relevant question 
                        here. If time came in discrete indivisible units then it would be reasonable to pick out 
                        one of these units as a single instance as one would say a water molecule is a single instance 
                        of water or a sand grain is a single instance of bucket of sand. But time as we know it is 
                        infinitely divisible; no matter how small a unit we pick we can always go smaller. We could
                        say a single instance of time is ∆t=0 that would mean that if we added a million or a quadrillion 
                        instances together, we would still get zero seconds. ∆t=0 is not quite an accurate description of 
                        a single instance of time. But then how do we define a single instance of time? What do physicists
                        mean when they say ‘instantaneous velocity’? Well an instance of time is actually represented by a 
                        theoretical number i.e. you can’t write it down, an infinitesimal number. Think of it as the closest 
                        possible number to zero while bearing in mind that any number you think of that isn’t zero can
                        always get closer to zero. So when defining velocity we take the limit of ∆t as it tends 
                        towards zero but never actually zero.
                    </p>

                    For deeper understanding, we could compare an infinitesimal number to transcendental numbers. 
                    Given a number line, there is no known scientific method to get a single point that accurately 
                    represents the transcendental number, π on the number line. All we can ever have is a range that 
                    we know for sure that π falls in between. To say 3.142 is an approximation of π simply means we 
                    know π falls in the range (3.1410, 3.142) with an error of δε=0.001. We could improve our 
                    approximation by adding more digits of precision and consequently reducing the error δε. In the same 
                    regard, we could say π is accurately represented when we take the limit of δε.

                    </div>
                    If the idea of limits never quite sinks in, no shame, it took some the smartest mathematicians
                    over 150 years to formally define the limit of a continuous function.

                    To move on to Dichotomy and Achilles and Tortoise, we must first realize that these two 
                    paradoxes are based on exactly the same idea, endlessly dividing distances. Because we keep 
                    reducing the distance Achilles travels in each iteration, we can continue forever without ever 
                    catching up with the tortoise. Now compare that to this version of the Dichotomy paradox: First we get 
                    to the half way point, then to the half way point of the remaining distance, then the halfway point of 
                    the remaining distance and on and on forever without ever getting to the final point. See, exactly the same idea.
                    There isn’t much to these two paradoxes other than the fact that the modern mathematician and Zeno disagree 
                    on what is mathematically computable. Given a continuous function that describes the Instantaneous velocity of 
                    an object with respect to time f(t)[which Zeno can’t comprehend anyway].  We can easily find the distance travelled 
                    after a certain time by integrating over the elapsed time [by using the idea of limits and adding all infinitesimal 
                    distance travelled per infinitesimal unit of time]. This means we can state accurately, the exact distance Achilles 
                    needs to travel to take the lead from the tortoise and the time it would take to finally complete your walk.
                    The development of limits of a continuous function might have taken us 150 years, but it was 150 years well spent 
                    because it gave us the power to compute infinite sums of converging functions and as well as being the driving 
                    force in the development of infinitesimal calculus. The inability to visualise infinity in any form is a defect 
                    common to all humans but like a blind man uses echo location to navigate his surroundings, we use mathematics to 
                    compute ideas we cannot comprehend. This isn’t an uncommon occurrence in mathematics as Benjamin Peirce, a 19-th 
                    century philosopher, mathematician and Harvard professor stated after proving Euler’s Identity: “it is absolutely 
                    paradoxical. We cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know 
                    it must be the truth.”

                    Suppose our universe had four spatial dimensions and were only able to sense three, how can 
                    comprehend the world of a being that perceives all four dimensions? Could we experience such a
                    world far beyond our reach? Will such a being even be able to explain exactly what it is that
                    we are missing? Well a ton of mathematicians have sort to answer these questions using simple logic 
                    and analogy…oh I missed a step: “What is the Fourth Spatial Dimension?”
                    We shall begin our journey to unravel the mysteries of the fourth dimension from the zero-th dimension. 
                    This is just a dimensionless point in space. No size what so ever, just a point. Not of much use 
                    in our journey so we’ll just move on.
                    A little bit more eventful though is the one-th dimension – A zero thickness line that 
                    extends infinitely in both directions. An object confined to move within this line is said to exist 
                    within a one-dimensional space. To keep track of the object’s movement we’ll mark a point on the line 
                    and call it the origin, we shall determine the position of the object relative to this point and we’ll 
                    call the line the abscissa or simply ‘x’.

                    plane. We’ll call the new line the ordinate or ‘y’. And now, the position of any object in the 
                    scene can be accurately described by two numbers: 'x' and 'y'.

                    A 4-dimensional space, what happens when we try to construct another line that is perpendicular to 
                    all three lines? You would be quick to realize that this is a square-the-circle task – Impossible. 
                    But why? We’ve been able to do it so far. Why can we seemingly not proceed beyond the third dimension? 
                    Does this mean there are really no higher dimensions than the third?
                    To understand why we — beings within a 3-dimensional world — can’t proceed beyond the third dimension, 
                    let’s imagine giving a similar task to our friend, the circle, that exists within a two dimensional world. 
                    We would like it to perform the simple task of constructing a line perpendicular to the two dimensions in 
                    its world.
                    Recall that the circle can only ever move within a perfectly flat plane (a 2-dimensional world). 
                    So if the circle starts to draw a line from a point A and moves a certain distance to a point B, 
                    the line drawn by the circle would also lie perfectly along the plane. In essesnce, no matter how 
                    many lines the cricle draws it would never be able to create one that is perpendicular to the 
                    2-dimensions it is constrained in.
                    An object in a single-dimensional world would not be able to construct another line that is perpendicular 
                    to the singular line it was born and raised to comprehend. And one in a zero dimensional world would not even 
                    know what a ‘line’ is and that’s because a world’s dimensions does not only describe possible movements but 
                    also the kind of shapes that can exist in the first place. By the way, in theory, there is no upper limit to 
                    the number of dimensions that can exist.
                    But this great wall that shuts our mind’s eye from the fourth dimension has not stopped some great 
                    mathematicians as several four dimensional shapes have been constructed and, to the best of our abilities, 
                    understood.
                    We’ll go over the process of creating the basic one, a Cube, a 4-dimensional cube known as the 
                    tesseract (hypercube). Constructing such a shape would mean we have to return to analogy to understand 
                    how the cube changes from on dimension to another.
                    A 1-dimensional world can only ever have lines, so we’ll imagine the cube to be a line that 
                    starts at the origin and extends a length of unity. With coordinates of the points (vertices) that make 
                    the line as: point 1, (0) and point 2, (1).
                    A similar shape in the 2-dimensions would be the typical square which has one edge at the origin 
                    with the coordinates: point 1, (0, 0), point 2, (0, 1), point 3, (1, 0) and point 4 (1,1)
                    It continues as shown in the table below:

                    From the table it is easy to determine that a line in 1-dimension has two vertices, 
                    a square in 2-dimensions has four vertices, a cube in 3-dimensions has eight vertices and the tesseract 
                    in 4-dimensions has 16 vertices.
                    ‘So what will this 16-vertex cube look like?’ you ask. Well, something like this:<b>#I'd like to add to this</b>
                    <br><br>
