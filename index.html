            <h1>Zeno's Paradoxes</h1>
            Calculus required continuity and continuity was supposed to require the <b>infinitely little</b>; but no
            one could discover what the <b>infinitely little</b> might me. &#8212 Bertrand Russell.<br>

            Although in my opinion and the opinion of many other mathematicians out there, this paradox has been resolved by modern calculus. It is however, 
            still fun to play around with the logic of a man who set out to prove that motion is just an illusion. <a href=posts.html>continue reading&#8230</a>

                The Fourth Dimension
            </h1>
            The 4D style, or cosmic comics and relativistic humor, is based on Einstein's theory of relativity 
            and I came up with it 20 years ago.
            4D works use the idea of the fourth dimension and time, 
            playing on such surrealistic and amazing subjects as motion relativity, space curvature and time dilation.‚Äù
